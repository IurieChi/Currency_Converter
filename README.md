This is a simple currency converter that converts from one currency to another

I have used tkinter library to create window form.

If you pres Convert button and you didnt slecet curensy or ammount you will receive a popup message to inform you that you need to select currency or ammount.

Curency is located in json file.

Functions disply_symbol, disply_name are used to extract from json object symbol of selecter curency and name.
